# Network-interdiction-problem

This is a article made on the results of AIMMS MOPTA competition hosted by Lehigh University, USA as a part of their annual MOPTA conference 2016 (https://aimms.com/english/news-archive/announcing-winners-years-aimms-mopta-modeling-competition/)

The problem statement was to formulate a network intediction problem (Graph cutting) to disrupt supply chain of an adversary (modelled as graph) using limited resources. A real world analogy can be conceptualized by considering a problem of destroying enemy transportation lines by bombing roads that are very crucial bringing about the greatest harm on them.

The article gives an insight on the problem statement and the solution methodology for a toy network. The results were presented during the conference and had recieved a good response from the event hosts.
